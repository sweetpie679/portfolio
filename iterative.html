            <p>Sonnet AI is a startup that aims to improve the process of writing sales and marketing 
                emails by leveraging advances in Artificial Intelligence, specifically language modeling. 
                Sonnetâ€™s product automates the process of writing personalized sales emails by populating 
                elements with relevant information tailored to individual clients.

            <p>Iterative design is a process that involves going back and forth from idea to final product 
                and refining as necessary. Before we began sketching 
                interfaces for our Sonnet application we decided as a group that a browser web application 
                would be the most effective interface. The intended users for this application are sales 
                representatives in a wide range of industries. For these users we want to provide a comfortable 
                and familiar experience to the email applications that they use in their daily life. With this 
                in mind we designed the Sonnet interfaces to provide structure in the form of well structured 
                directories, client tags, familiar email interfaces, etc. to help facilitate their navigation 
                throughout the application, while providing them the added value of AI assistance to help them 
                draft sales emails more quickly.

            <p> Now that we have laid the foundations in the previous steps now we are able 
                to build off the wireframe developed and build a full-on high 
                fidelity prototype using Figma, and subject it to a round of critiques. 
                We then improved the interface by incorporating the feedback from critiques.</p>

            <h1 id="lessons">Lessons learned</h1>
            <p> I learned the critical steps in the iterative design process, incorporating 
                different design thinking from sketches to mockups to user testing. The project 
                was helpful to me in numerous ways. It opened my mind to how user feedback through mockups and 
                user testing can help to improve the interface. I also learned critical thinking through the process.
