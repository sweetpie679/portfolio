            <h1 id="project">Project Overview</h1>
            <p>The project aims to identify design issues for the Tilapia Hotel Limited website. I imagine a busy tourist 
                who is very naive about online platforms and is in a hurry to check room availability for his family. 
                Before booking, users need to be assured of the availability, so they check using the form on the page. 
                I chose the page because it is an excellent interface to explore where usability problems might arise and 
                how users might unknowingly be unaware of such issues. Despite being accessible, the interface presents several 
                challenges for users (especially first-time users). This work aims to improve the online experience for tourists 
                to meet their daily needs during vacations abroad. Users reveal booking a room as something that reflects their 
                everyday experience; they check/ask for availability and then make a booking. This is what I incorporate into the interface.

        <div class="subsection">
            <h1 id="problem">The Problem</h1>
            <p>The site looks confusing, with many images, button placement, and the main menu at the top and bottom of the page, 
                which could hinder learnability. 
                While images can aid memorability, the site uses many for no good reason, which could lead to confusion for users. 
                In terms of efficiency, the site presents a bottleneck; users might spend considerable time wondering how to navigate 
                the site. Users' conceptual model does not align with the website; it allows them to contact them when they want to make 
                decisions on the fly. Running WebAIM identified issues related to empty labels, low contrast between text and background 
                colours, and missing first-level headings. The most significant one was that the page was not responsive.

            <h1 id="design">Design Approach</h1>
            <p> In the design process, we follow the standard rule. We design Lo-fi diagrams to depict the interface we want. From those lo-fi's, we develop hi-fi images 
                of how exactly we want our website to look. The interfaces presented here are for mobile, tablet and desktop users.

            <h1 id="lessons">Lessons learned</h1>
            <p> In this project, we learned how to identify 
                flaws in existing website interfaces, using design thinking to improve them and 
                applying knowledge and skills from class to redesign them. The end goal is to enhance 
                users' experience as they interact with these interfaces.
