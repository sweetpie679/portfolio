            <p>This project aims to understand the value of quantitative and qualitative user tests for evaluating different UI designs.  
                User behavior data is collected and analyzed through quantitative data in A/B Testing and qualitative data in Eye Tracking.

            <h1 id="problem">The Problem</h1>
            <p>A/B Testing is a common technique used to evaluate an interfaceâ€™s performance by randomly presenting 
                version A and version B to users. Between these versions, data is collected and analyzed to test hypotheses, 
                evaluate performance, and inform design changes or improvements to the experience. Eye Tracking is also a standard 
                method for assessing the performance of a page. While A/B Testing is quantitative, Eye Tracking is its qualitative 
                counterpart. It is used in industry to evaluate the usability of a page, as well as how efficient it is at guiding users.

        <div class="subsection">
            <h1 id="design">Design Approach</h1>
            <p> We redesigned two static pairs of the bakery homepage  
                and called one version A and another version B). To analyze the eye tracking data, we generated a heatmap (a still image 
                that depicts where your user gazes were fixed) and an animated replay of their gaze motion; both overlaid on the interface 
                to see what interface elements test participants were looking at. We wanted to see whether the results matched our expectations.

            <h1 id="lessons">Lessons learned</h1>
            <p> A/B testing and Eye-tracking are powerful approaches to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the efficiency of a user interface. 
                The data analysis results informed us of the necessary changes that improved our user interface. As we thought before, the results matched 
                our hypothesis. I also learned a lot about hypothesis formulation and evaluation..
