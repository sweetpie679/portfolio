            <h1 id="project">Project Overview</h1>
            <p>The goal of the project was to explore realistic personas of users and storyboarding 
                user journeys as they interact with a chosen interface. We gathered user interaction 
                insights by observing users as they naturally interacted with an interface of a water 
                fountain in a public space kitchen. We were interested in learning how user interfaces 
                might affect the user's experience and how we can improve them, … yes … improving user 
                experience is our primary  goal.

            <h1 id="problem">The Problem</h1>
            <p>The empathy maps below represent the personas of two users: John Doe and Jane Fox. 
                Empathy maps are helpful tools for understanding user pain points and presenting in 
                matrix form to explain what the users think, feel, say and do with the interface. 
                They are used to personalize the design process on the developer side

            <h1 id="design">Design Approach</h1>
            <p> Insights from the empathy maps helped us create storyboards to illustrate the real journey
                of user interaction with an interface. The storyboard below follows the entire interaction
                journey of John Doe's persona as he interacts with the newly installed water fountain in the 
                kitchen. We can learn from storyboard challenges users face and use design thinking to improve them.</p>

            <h1 id="lessons">Lessons learned</h1>
            <p> The project was helpful to me in numerous ways. It opened my mind to how user interfaces can be improved 
                by learning from real users. It changed my thinking that designers initially did interfaces only to something
                 that involved understanding users' needs and pain points and getting into their shoes to solve their problems.
